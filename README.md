Karma is a mobile application empowered by Lens Protocol.
It is a community DApp where people earn karma points by donating food, clothes, or anything that can be useful for others.
To join, you connect your wallet and log in, then you will be prompted to create a profile.
After logging in, you can now explore the features of Karma.
The home is a feed where people can post their items and their meeting location.
People near the meeting spot can claim it. Afterward, they can chat and set when they will meet.
After the transaction, the giver is then rewarded one Karma point while others can reward him/her too in a newer post.
